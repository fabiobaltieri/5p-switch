=================================


This project is a five port managed switch based on a Micrel KSZ8995 and an
Atmel ATMega168 microcontroller.

Firmware
--------

Building requires an avr-gcc toolchain, in the firmware/ directory, to build
run:

  make

Flashing the firmware on the device requires avrdude and a compatible hardware
programmer. Default configuration is stored at the beginning of the Makefile.
To program with the default configuration, run:

  make load

Fuses can be configured running:

  make fuse 

Hardware
--------

The switch can be configured in unmanaged mode by not shorting any jumper.

To configure the switch in SPI slave mode, PS[1:0] have to be set to 10, so
just short the pins 1 and 2 of SJ2.
